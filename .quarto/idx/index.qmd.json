The course consists of lectures with recommendations for data storage, project organisation, and data sharing and archiving. There will also be a practical component where students will get hands-on experience developing a Data Management Plan (DMP) using the [DMPonline](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl) platform.\n\n## Schedule\n\n### Part 1\n\nTBD\n\n### Part 3\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nschedule <- read_csv(\"2022-2023_training-sessions.csv\")\n\nschedule %>%\n    filter(Date > Sys.Date(),\n        Session == \"Part 3\") %>%\n    select(!Session) %>%\n    knitr::kable()\n```\n\n## Training outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course, you should be familiar with:\n\n- The importance of proper data...\n    + management\n    + storage\n    + documentation\n- Developing your own DMP\n- Personal data considerations\n\n## Important info\n\nThe course will take 5.5 - 7 h (depending if your DMP includes collection of personal data)\ndivided into three parts over 6 – 9 months.\n\nYou will receive 1 GS for completing the training.\n\nCertificates will be provided after the sessions, and can be uploaded to [DMA](dma.tudelft.nl) (You can choose any of the three categories in DMA).\n\nIf you need to submit your PhD agreement before following one of these trainings, under the section Other Arrangements – Data Management Plan, depending on the training you will follow, you can indicate one of the following:\n\n1. Data Management Plan Training for 3mE PhD students\n    - You are going to follow Data Management Plan Training for 3mE PhD students delivered by the faculty data steward within the first year of the PhD.\n    - During this training, you will create a DMP in DMPonline and consult the faculty data steward.\n    - After the training, you will discuss your DMP with your PhD supervisor(s).  \n    - You will include your DMP in the Go/No Go Decision. \n2. Research Data Management 101\n    - You are going to follow Research Data Management 101 delivered by the TU Delft Library within the first year of the PhD. \n    - During this training, you will create a DMP in DMPonline and consult the trainers, and the faculty data steward if needed.\n    - After the training, you will discuss your DMP with your PhD supervisor(s).  \n    - You will include your DMP in the Go/No Go Decision. \n\nIt is the responsibility of the PhD supervisor(s) to approve the DMP, not the Data Steward.
