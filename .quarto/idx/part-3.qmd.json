You can also add questions about legal issues, Intellectual\nProperty Rights, confidentiality, subsidy, publication of outputs (paper,\npresentations, etc.) and software licenses. Additionally, if you have questions\nregarding the content in the self-study module, please add them as well.\n\n### Workflow presentation\n\nDuring the interactive session.\n\nPrepare a **2-3 min presentation** about how you are applying in your daily work what\nyou have learned during the Part 1 of this training and wrote in your DMP.\nAnd perhaps you have some handy tips that you can share with your fellow PhD students.\nEach participant will present their presentation during the online interactive session.\nYou can keep this as an oral presentation or show a figure or some slides. It is\ncompletely up to you. If it helps here are some questions that you can take\ninto consideration for your homework:\n\n- Are you confident with how you store your data/code? Is your data stored in a secure environment and is it backed up?    \n- Is your data/code properly documented?    \n- For example, can your supervisor or another colleague easily figure out which file is what? If they open some of the files, are they properly labelled and described?    \n- Crucially, what if you left TU Delft tomorrow? Would your supervisor and (future) colleagues be able to make sense of your data and how your research was done?   "},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"part-3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.16","theme":"cosmo","title":"Part 3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
