And perhaps you have some handy tips that you can share with your fellow PhD students. Each participant will present their presentation during the online interactive session. You can keep this as an oral presentation or show a figure or some slides. It is completely up to you. If it helps here are some questions that you can take into consideration for your homework:\n\nAre you confident with how you store your data/code? Is your data stored in a secure environment and is it backed up?    \nIs your data/code properly documented?    \nFor example, can your supervisor or another colleague easily figure out which file is what? If they open some of the files, are they properly labelled and described?    \nCrucially, what if you left TU Delft tomorrow? Would your supervisor and (future) colleagues be able to make sense of your data and how your research was done?"
